# My Minecraft Datapacks
It's a repository where I store my Minecraft Datapacks

## Datapack List:

#### Rising Lava;


### Rising Lava

#### Concept:
In a 100x100 blocks area, the players need to survive a different threat. The lava is rising every 18 seconds. Since layer 0 to layer 256. Every AIR block is replaced for a LAVA block!

#### Instructions:
YOU NEED TO EXTRACT THIS FILE IN THE FOLLOWING FOLDER:

.minecraft/saves/[your world]/datapacks/

NOW, ALL COMMANDS ARE SET. 

IN THE WORLD THAT YOU PUT THE DATAPACK FILE, YOU NEED TO DO THE FOLLOWING COMMAND:

/reload

AND:

/datapack list

IF THE DATAPACK ISN'T RECOGNIZED BY THE GAME, TRY TO DO THE PREVIOUS STEPS AGAIN.

OTHERWISE, CONTINUE WITH THE FOLLOWIG:

/function comandos:start

ALRIGHT, IT'S WORKING! EVERY 18 SECONDS THE LAVA WILL RISE ONE LAYER.

HAVE FUN!
